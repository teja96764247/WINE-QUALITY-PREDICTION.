Fixed Acidity: Fixed acidity in wine refers to the total concentration of non-volatile acids, such as tartaric, malic, and lactic acids. It contributes to the wine's taste, structure, and stability. The presence of fixed acidity provides a refreshing tartness and helps in balancing the wine's flavor profile, making it an important component for overall taste and aging potential.

Volatile Acidity: Volatile acidity in wine refers to the concentration of acids that can vaporize, such as acetic acid. While small amounts of volatile acidity can contribute to the wine's complexity, excessive levels can lead to undesirable vinegar-like aromas and flavors. Controlling volatile acidity is crucial in maintaining the wine's quality and preventing off-flavors.

Citric Acid: Citric acid is a natural acid found in wine, often originating from the grapes themselves. It can contribute to the wine's freshness and fruitiness, enhancing its overall flavor profile. However, excessive levels of citric acid can lead to a sour or overly acidic taste, so its presence must be balanced to ensure a harmonious wine.

Residual Sugar: Residual sugar refers to the natural sugars remaining in the wine after fermentation. It can contribute to the wine's sweetness, body, and mouthfeel. Wines with higher residual sugar levels tend to have a sweeter taste, while those with lower levels are drier. The presence of residual sugar is important in defining the wine's style and can influence its pairing with food.

Chlorides: Chlorides in wine, originating from the soil and winemaking process, can impact the wine's taste and stability. While small amounts of chlorides can contribute to the wine's complexity, excessive levels can lead to a salty or briny taste, negatively affecting the overall flavor profile.

Free Sulfur Dioxide: Free sulfur dioxide is used in winemaking as a preservative to prevent oxidation and microbial spoilage. It plays a crucial role in maintaining the wine's freshness, stability, and aging potential. Proper levels of free sulfur dioxide are essential for ensuring the wine's longevity and quality.

Total Sulfur Dioxide: Total sulfur dioxide encompasses both the free and bound forms of sulfur dioxide in wine. It serves as a preservative and antioxidant, protecting the wine from spoilage and oxidation. Monitoring total sulfur dioxide levels is important for ensuring the wine's shelf life and overall quality.

Density: Density in wine is a measure of its mass per unit volume and can provide insights into the wine's alcohol content and potential sweetness. It contributes to the wine's body and mouthfeel, with higher density wines often exhibiting a richer and more viscous texture.

pH: The pH level of wine influences its acidity, microbial stability, and color stability. It plays a crucial role in shaping the wine's overall taste and mouthfeel. Proper pH levels are important for ensuring the wine's balance and longevity.

Sulphates: Sulphates, often in the form of sulfur dioxide, are used in winemaking as a preservative and antimicrobial agent. They help prevent oxidation and microbial spoilage, contributing to the wine's stability and longevity. However, excessive levels of sulphates can lead to undesirable aromas and flavors, so their presence must be carefully managed.

Alcohol: The alcohol content of wine contributes to its body, texture, and overall flavor profile. It influences the wine's warmth, mouthfeel, and perceived sweetness. The alcohol level is an important factor in defining the wine's style and can impact its aging potential.
